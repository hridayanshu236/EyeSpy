##  Overview
EyeSpy is an AI-powered object detection system designed to **detect cheating in offline classroom exams** using real-time video surveillance.  
Unlike online proctoring tools, EyeSpy is focused on physical classrooms where invigilation is still manual and error-prone.

- **Framework**: YOLOv8 + PyTorch  
- **Dataset**: 880+ labeled images (cheating & non-cheating scenarios)  
- **Accuracy**: Achieved **92% precision** and **85% recall**  
- **Deployment**: Supports ONNX export for cross-platform compatibility

##  Features
- 📷 **Real-time Cheating Detection** using webcams  
- 🏷 **Binary Classification**: Cheating vs Non-cheating  
- 🔄 **Data Augmentation** for robust performance  
- 🚀 **Lightweight YOLOv8s** model for fast inference  
- 📊 **Performance Metrics**: Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix  

---

##  Tech Stack
- **Programming**: Python 3.8+  
- **Frameworks**: PyTorch, Ultralytics YOLOv8  
- **Data Processing**: Albumentations, NumPy, OpenCV  
- **Training**: Kaggle GPU (Tesla T4)
